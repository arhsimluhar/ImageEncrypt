1. Introduction: The Fourier transform (FT) is undoubtedly one of the most valuable and requently usedtools in signalprocessing and analysis [1]. A generalization of Fourier transform, the fractional Fourier transform (commonly referred to as FRFT in the literature), was first  introduced by Victor Namias in 1980 [2]. He was apparently unaware of the previous works of N. Wiener in 1929, H. Weyl in 1930, E. U. Condon in 1937, H. Kober in 1939, A. P. Guinand in 1956, A. L. Patterson in 1959, V. Bargmann in 1961, De Bruijn in 1973 and R. S. Khare in 1974 [3–4],  and of others. Though the idea was the same, these authors discussed the FRFT in a broader  context and not by the same name. Mustard [5] in 1987 did considerable work considering Condon and Bargmann as his base without citing Namias’ work. Moreover, as FRFT is a special case of inear canonical transform (LCT), all the work previously done on LCT covers FRFT in some sense. In some cases, FRFT is not given any special attention but in other cases the authors have commented on it as one-parameter subclass with the FT as a special case.
