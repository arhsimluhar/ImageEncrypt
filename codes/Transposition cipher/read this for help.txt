Transposition encryption technique:

This program helps you to encrypt any text file using transposition encryption technique.
Steps:

1.	save the .rar file in your hard drive.
2.	Exert the file transposition_cipher.rar.
3.	Open the Transposition_encryption.m file in matlab
4.	Run this file and change the directory.
5.	Go to the command window.
6.	Type  Transposition_encryption(6).
Where ‘6’ in the brackets is the order of the matrix which is used by transposition encryption technique.
 
7.	Press enter.
Now your encrypt file is in the same directory. Name as trans_encryp.txt check this.


For decryption:

In the m-file change the input address file plain.txt  with  trans_encryp.txt and a new file name at the place of ouput file as ‘new.txt’.

After this repeat the steps from 4 to 7 and you get your original data back in ‘new.txt’ file in the same directory.

Thanks.
